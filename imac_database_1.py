# table = contains rows and columns             fancy name = Relation
# row = the object                              fancy name = tuple (not to be confused with Python tuple)
# column = the attribute                        fancy name = attribute

# schema - the titles of the columns, and the rules of what data type they should be

# a relation (table) is 'a set of tuples (rows) that have the same attributes'

# e.g.  row 'Michael', columns Age, City, Race, etc.

# SQL - structured query language - the language we use to issue commands to the database

# CRUD - Create Read Update Delete   -- comamands to Database

# Three major Database Management Systems in wide use:
# Oracle - Large, commercial, enterprise scale, very very tweakble
# MySql - now owned by Oracle, open source, simpler but very fast and scalable -- lots of websites use this
# MariaDB - copy of MySQL that happened when Oracle bought MySQL
# SqlServer - Very Nice, from Microsoft (also Access)

# Other smaller, free and open source:  HSQL, SQLite, Postgress...
# SQLite is an embedded database - built into software (Oracle, MSql are not like that, they are separate, complete software)
